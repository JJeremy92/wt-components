        <h2>What is a Design System?</h2>
<div className="grid-2">
    <div>

        <p>Design Systems bring order and cohesion to digital products. They help protect the brand, elevate the user experience, and increase the speed and efficiency of designing and building products.</p>

        <p>Design systems in software are often compared to LEGO bricks. Just as LEGO bricks allow the construction of diverse models through imagination, software components enable various builds. However, guidelines and instructions are crucial to achieve consistent, high-quality builds.</p>

        <p>Design systems offer guidelines and education to product teams comparable to a LEGO instruction manual for builders, ensuring successful, cohesive software development at scale.</p>
